What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects 
rather than functions and logic. An object is a data structure that contains:
1. Data (attributes/properties)
2. Behavior (methods/functions)

Key Principles of OOP:
1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit
2. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details
3. Inheritance: Creating new classes from existing ones
4. Polymorphism: Using a single interface for different data types

Why use OOP?
- Makes code more modular and reusable
- Easier to maintain and modify
- Models real-world problems more naturally
- Reduces code duplication

"""
In this tutorial, we'll cover these OOP concepts in Python:

1. Classes and Objects
   - Creating classes and instantiating objects
   - The __init__ method (constructor)
   - Instance attributes vs class attributes

2. Methods
   - Instance methods
   - Class methods
   - Static methods

3. Encapsulation
   - Public, protected, and private attributes
   - Getter and setter methods
   - Property decorators

4. Inheritance
   - Single inheritance
   - Multiple inheritance
   - Method resolution order (MRO)
   - Overriding methods

5. Polymorphism
   - Duck typing
   - Operator overloading
   - Method overriding

6. Special Methods (Magic/Dunder methods)
   - __str__ and __repr__
   - __len__, __getitem__, etc.
   - Operator overloading methods

7. Advanced Topics
   - Abstract base classes
   - Class composition vs inheritance
   - Design patterns with OOP

8. Practical Applications
   - Building real-world class hierarchies
   - When to use OOP vs procedural programming
   - Best practices in Python OOP
